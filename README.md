# -Hr-Analysis-Report-Dashboard-using-Power-BI.
An interactive HR Analytics Dashboard built in Power BI showcasing key metrics like employee count, attrition rate, job satisfaction, and age-wise insights for better HR decision-making.

1. Project Title

HR Analytics Dashboard using Power BI with SQL Connectivity

2. Goal of the Project

The main goal of this project is to analyze employee data and provide insights into attrition, workforce demographics, job satisfaction, and departmental trends. This helps HR managers and decision-makers to identify retention issues, improve employee satisfaction, and optimize HR strategies.

3. Process (Workflow)

Data Collection – Employee data was taken from CSV files and SQL database.

Data Cleaning & Transformation – Used Power Query to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and transform data into usable format.

Data Modeling – Built relationships between tables, created calculated columns & measures using DAX.

Dashboard Development – Designed interactive Power BI visualizations such as KPIs, pie charts, bar charts, and donut charts.

Analysis & Insights – Applied filters, slicers, and drill-down features for HR decision-making.

4. Details of Features

KPIs:

Total Employees, Current Employees, Ex-Employees

Attrition Rate (%)

Average Age of Employees

Attrition Analysis:

Department-wise Attrition (R&D, Sales, HR)

Education field vs Attrition

Age group vs Attrition by Gender

Demographics:

Employee Count by Age Band

Education Level Distribution

Employee Satisfaction:

Job Role vs Satisfaction Ratings (1–4 scale)

Interactivity:

Drill-down analysis for deeper insights

5. Solutions Provided by Dashboard

Helps HR to identify high attrition departments (e.g., Sales has higher attrition).

Shows age groups & gender most affected by attrition.

Provides insight into education fields contributing most to employee exit.

Highlights job roles with low satisfaction, guiding HR to take corrective actions.

Supports data-driven HR strategy for retention and workforce planning.

6. Technology Stack

Power BI → Dashboard creation & visualization

Power Query → Data cleaning & transformation

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) → Calculated columns, KPIs, and measures

SQL Database → Data source connectivity

CSV Files → Initial raw dataset integration

7. Learnings from the Project

Learned how to connect multiple data sources (SQL + CSV).

Improved skills in Power Query for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load).

Hands-on with DAX functions like CALCULATE, SUMX, DIVIDE for KPIs.

Enhanced data visualization techniques (pie, donut, KPI cards, clustered bar).

Understood real-world HR challenges like attrition & satisfaction analysis.

8. Business Impact / Value Addition

HR can reduce attrition by 10–15% by focusing on at-risk groups.

Identifies departments needing training & engagement programs.

Provides a data-driven HR strategy instead of assumptions.

Saves time by replacing manual reporting with an automated dashboard.

9. Future Enhancements

Predictive Analytics for forecasting attrition using Machine Learning.

Integration with real-time HR systems (SAP, Workday).
